            <p>Select any tile and it will flip over. Each attempt requires that you flip over two tiles. If they match, your score goes up by one point and those tiles both disappear. If they do not match, the tiles will flip back over so you can make another attempt to match different tiles. Do your best to remember what images are on the tiles you have already interacted with, as it will help you clear the board in fewer attempts. The fewer attempts it takes you to clear the board, the better your performance and the higher your final score will be!</p>
